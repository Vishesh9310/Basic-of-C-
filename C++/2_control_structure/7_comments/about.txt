In c++ comments are two types:
1. Single line comments: It is used where we need to comment single line. single line comments start with double slash // .

2. Multiline comments: It is used where we need to comment more than one line. It is surrounded by slash and aestrisks /**/ .
example: 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    //this is a single line comment

    /*
    this is a 
    multi line comment
    */
    
    return 0;
}
