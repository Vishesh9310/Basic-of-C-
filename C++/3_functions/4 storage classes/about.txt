//Storage classes:
Storage classes are keywords in C++ programming that determine the lifespan, scope, and storage location of variables inside a program.
Storage classes govern how variables are kept in memory, how long they persist, and how and where they may be retrieved.

C++ has four major storage classes:
1. auto:
It is the default storage class for local variables declared within a block or function.
Variables with the "auto" storage class have automatic storage duration,
meaning they are created when the block or function is entered and destroyed when it's exited.
They are typically stored on the stack.
the "auto" keyword is rarely used directly because local variables are considered "auto" by default.

2. register:
The "register" storage class is used to instruct the compiler to store a variable in a register,
which is a tiny, fast-access storage space within the CPU. However, the compiler is free to ignore this request,
and modern compilers often optimize register usage automatically.
Variables with the "register" storage class also have automatic storage duration.

3. static:
Variables declared with the "static" storage class have static storage duration,
meaning they are allocated memory for the entire program's duration.
They are created when the program starts and destroyed when it terminates.
The "static" variables have local scope within a block or function, but their values persist across function calls.
They are typically stored in a separate data segment of memory.

4. extern:
The "extern" storage class is used to declare variables that are defined in other source files.
It extends the visibility of a variable to the entire program.
"extern" variables have global scope, and they are often used to share variables across multiple source files.

5. mutable:
In situations where you need to modify specific data members within a const function while keeping other members unchanged,
the 'mutable' keyword comes into play.
The 'mutable' keyword allows modifying a data member of a const object, even within const member functions.
