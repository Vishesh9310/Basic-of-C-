Functions:

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes out program easy to understand and reuse.

advantages:
1. we can aboid rewriting same logic/code again and again in a program.
2. we can call c++ function easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
3. we can track a large C++ program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
4. Reusability is the main achievement of C functions.
5. however function calling is always an overhead in a C++ program.

Function aspects:
there are three aspects of a c++ function.

1. function declaration: A function must be declared globally in a C++ program to tell the compiler about the function name, function parameters,
and return type.

2. function call: Function can be called from anywhere in the program. The parameter list must not differ in function calling and function declaration.
we must pass the same number of functions as it is declared in the function declaration.

3. function defination: It contains the actual statements which are to be executed. It is the most important aspect to which the control comes when the function is called.
Here, we must notice that only one value can be returned from the function.

//function declaration
return_type function_name(argument list);

//function call
function_name(argument_list);

//funciton defination
return_type function_name(argument_list){
    function body;
}

Types of function: 
1. standard library functions
2. User-defined functions
