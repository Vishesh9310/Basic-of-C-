An operator is a symbol that operates on a value to perform specific mathematical or logical computations. They form the foundation of any programming language. In C++, we have built-in operators to provide the required functionality.

An operator operates the operands. For example, 

int c = a + b;
Here, ‘+’ is the addition operator. ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the operands that are being ‘added’.

Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:
1. Arithmetic Operators:Unary(pre(++a,--a),post(a++,a--)),Binary(+,-,*,/,%)
2. Relational Operators:(==,!=,>)
3. Logical Operators:(&&,||,!)
4. Bitwise Operators:(&,|,^,~,<<,>>)
5. Assignment Operators:(=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
6. Ternary or Conditional Operators: Expression1 ? Expression2 : Expression13
