//Referemce vs Pointer:
C++ reference and pointer seem to be similar, but there are some differences that exist between them.
A reference is a variable which is another name of the existing variable,
while the pointer is variable that stores the address of another variable.

Differences between references and pointer:
1. Definition.
2. Declaration: &(reference),*(pointer).
3. Reassignment: (reference cannot reassign)(pointer can be reassign).
4. Memory Address:
    (In the case of reference, both the reference and actual variable refer to the same address.
    The new variable will not be assigned to the reference variable until the actual variable is either deleted or goes out of the scope.)
    (In the case of pointers, both the pointer variable and the actual variable will have different memory addresses).
5. NULL value: (cannot assign in reference),(pointer can be assigned).
6. Indirection: (cannot be in references),(pointers can have pointer to pointer offering more than one level of indirection).
7. Arithmetic Operations: (compile time error),(can be applied to pointers names as "Pointer Arithmetic").
