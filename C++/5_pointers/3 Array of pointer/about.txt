//About:
    Array and pointers are closely related to each other.
    In C++, the name of an array is considered as a pointer, i.e., the name of an array contains the address of an element.
    C++ considers the array name as the address of the first element.
    For example, if we create an array, i.e.,
    marks which hold the 20 values of integer type, then marks will contain the address of first element, i.e., marks[0].
    Therefore, we can say that array name (marks) is a pointer which is holding the address of the first element of an array.

//Array of Pointers:
    An array of pointers is an array that consists of variables of pointer type,
    which means that the variable is a pointer addressing to some other element.
    Suppose we create an array of pointer holding 5 integer pointers;
    then its declaration would look like:
    
    int *ptr[5]; //array of 5 integer pointer.
    
    In the above declaration, we declare an array of pointer named as ptr,
    and it allocates 5 integer pointers in memory.

    The element of an array of a pointer can also be initialized by assigning the address of some other element.
    Let's observe this case through an example.

int a; // variable declaration.  
ptr[2] = &a;

In the above code, we are assigning the address of 'a' variable to the third element of an array 'ptr'.
We can also retrieve the value of 'a' be dereferencing the pointer.

*ptr[2];

//Array of Pointer to Strings:
An array of pointer to strings is an array of character pointers that holds the address of the first character of a string or we can say the base address of a string.


//The following are the differences between an array of pointers to string and two-dimensional array of characters:
1. An array of pointers to string is more efficient than the two-dimensional array of characters in case of memory consumption because an array of pointer to strings
consumes less memory than the two-dimensional array of characters to store the strings.

2. In an array of pointers, the manipulation of strings is comparatively easier than in the case of 2d array.
We can also easily change the position of the strings by using the pointers.
