//Defination:
    The sizeof() is an operator that evaluates the size of data type, constants, variable.
    It is a compile-time operator as it returns the size of any variable or a constant at the compilation time.
    The size, which is calculated by the sizeof() operator, is the amount of RAM occupied in the computer.

syntax of the sizeof() operator is given below:

sizeof(data_type);

//The sizeof() operator can be applied to the following operand types:

1. when an operand is of data type.
2. when an operand is of Class type.
    a.  If we add one more integer variable in a class.
        then the code return 8 bytes output.
    b.  If we add a char variable in the above code.
        then the code return 12 byter output (int+int+char)=4+4+1 and pulus structure padding.
3. when a operand is of array type.
4. when an operand is of pointer type.
5. when an operand is an expression.
